        This Cookie Policy explains how Seedcore Foundation dba Beyond Measure ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar

      <p className="mb-4">
        Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used
        by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Seedcore Foundation dba Beyond Measure) are called "first party cookies". Cookies
        set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or
        functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that
        set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits
        certain other websites.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Why do we use cookies?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We use first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website
        to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target
        the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Website for
        advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">How can I control cookies?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences
        in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which categories of cookies you accept or reject.
        Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may

        amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to
        time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique
        identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Website or opened an e-mail including them. This allows us,
        for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with
        cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to
        improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are
        reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect
        and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for other site operations. If you do not want Flash
        Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools
        contained in the{' '}

          Global Storage Settings Panel
        </a>{' '}
        and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies
        (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your
        being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the
        page you are on at the time). Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may
        reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection
        with our services or online content.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Do you serve targeted advertising?</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Website. These companies may
        use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services
        that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. This
        can be accomplished by them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in
        order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information collected through
        this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other details that directly identify you unless
        you choose to provide these.
